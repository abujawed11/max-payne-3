Despite massive improvement in traffic safety 1.2 million people are still killed in traffic every year. 
To reduce this problem autonomous car technology is very helpful. Allowing the car to act automatically 
is crucial when moving towards the future cars will not crash at all. The present system for auto braking 
lane-keeping aid and adaptive cruise control are examples of the first steps towards autonomous driving. 
Then other features include road edge and barrier detection with steer assist, which detects if the near 
about to drive off the round and autonomously applies steering torque to bring the vehicles back on track. 
Autonomous driving will carry significant consumer benefit, it will fundamentally change the way we look at 
driving cars. As a driver in the future, you will be able to plan your drive with a mix of autonomous and 
active driving, allowing for efficient use of your daily journey. You could safely interact via phone or 
tablet or simply relax. Autonomous driving safely thereby paves the way for more efficient time management 
behind the wheel. In addition to simplifying people`s lived and transforming the everyday commute from last 
time to quality time, self-driving cars create environmental benefits. An autonomous driving car is no 
longer available due to exceptional weather conditions, technical malfunction or the end of the rotation 
has been reached. At this time the driver is promoted by the system to take over again. But except this car 
is very useful to the consumers. It is not only useful but also safer when compared to the other cars which are present.
